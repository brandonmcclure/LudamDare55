the progress bar is rendered when the intro text is tendered, and it it over top of it
the ui will not scale
the player's summon level should increase to major milestones that increase your view and visually indicate your changes
game state transitions are poorly defined. There is an enum in HUD which the main scene interacts with. I do not have the ability to stop enemies or player movement at the main menu or the game over screen
when you win the game, I should be able to click or touch to skip through the win text.
time playing aka $StarTimer does not reset between games. It would be cool to keep a history of a sessions's plays
