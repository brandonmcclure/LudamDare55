## Retrospective

This game jam allowed me to dive into godot for first time (except for the [2d creeps tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)). My game is very rough, but i created a win/lose criteria, and I enjoyed brainstorming ideas for this theme. 

I learned a lot about gd script and Godot's signals, and that knowledge will help me extend the game, and in future projects. I did loose some time trying to make Godot 3 documentation on collision detection work with my Godot 4 project. I think documenting my toolchain before I start a gamejam will help me ensure I am keeping my searching on point. I enjoy working with gotdot. I already have started [Brandon Davis](https://github.com/davisbrandon02)' Colony sim tutorial ([src](https://github.com/davisbrandon02/colony-sim-tutorial) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-hFhoXjVl1hq0j9lxgRCzxkBpDZhDlT))
